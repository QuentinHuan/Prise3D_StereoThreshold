* rebuild project
* copy the folder Content in the corresponding folder of your Ue4 project
* restart the editor and open Blueprint/Manager
* change the type of component/P3dComponent to P3dComponent
* delete, recreate and relink the blocks Log, Random2d, readFile, and getImagePath
* compile and check for errors
* do the same for Blueprint/ManagerTutorial, and ManagerSpherical
